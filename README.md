I developed a Java programming project during a train journey to challenge myself and improve my skills.,i was  inspired by my nephew's homeworkðŸ˜‚ .Additionally, I licensed the code under the MIT License, allowing others to utilize or distribute it. Overall, I am proud of the project and the effort put into it.

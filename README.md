I developed a Java programming project during a train journey to challenge myself and improve my skills.,i was  inspired by my nephew's homeworkðŸ˜‚ .Additionally, I licensed the code under the MIT License, allowing others to utilize or distribute it. Overall, I am proud of the project and the effort put into it.

## How to Run the Program

2. Open Cmd, Gitbash, or your IDE terminal.

3. Navigate to the directory where the project is located.

4. Compile the source code by running the following command:

```

```

5. Run the program by executing the following command:

## Program Description

This Java program prompts the user to enter a number and then generates three different square shapes using asterisks (*), depending on the input number. 

The first square is a filled square of size n x n, where n is the input number. The second square is an outline of a square of size n x n, and the third square is an outline with diagonals of a square of size n x n. 

After generating each square, the program asks the user if they want to continue and prompts them to enter 'y' or 'n'. If the user enters 'y', the program will ask for another input number and generate the three squares for the new input number. If the user enters 'n', the program will terminate. 

This program includes error handling to prevent a java.util.InputMismatchException if the user enters a non-integer input.
